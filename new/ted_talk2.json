Today's talk is for all of us who get sort of lost and confused when we hear too much business jargon. Terms like find the synergy or value add. In his plain spoken 2022 talk from TEDx Vienna, journalist and consultant Bob Wilkfong helps all of us cut out the BS in business speak so we can better understand one another after a break. Hi, I'm Anne Morris. And I'm Frances Frey. We're the hosts of a new podcast from TED called Fixable. We've helped leaders at some of the world's most influential companies solve all kinds of issues. And here on our new show, we're taking your calls and having unfiltered conversations that will help you fix your workplace problems in a single session. You'll hear about how to fix our broken meeting culture. People feel like a meeting is a thing you put on a calendar and then people show up and that's it. And that is a meeting, but it is not actually what is the best use of that time. Check out Fixable wherever you listen to podcasts. I am fluent in the language of BS, otherwise known as business speak or bullshit, depending on your point of view. What is BS or business speak? Business speak is the language we use on the job and only on the job to describe and define things. For instance, at home I might say to my son, it's time to go. Are you ready? While at work, I'm more likely to say to a colleague, is it scalable? You can give me a baseline ETA on departure. We need to leave ASAP, right? I was first introduced to the language of BS through my wife. She's a chief marketing officer for a global consulting firm and one day a few years back at home she was doing a conference call on speaker and she started to use the language of BS. I had never heard this woman speak this language before. I was concerned she was a spy. She used terms like boil the ocean, tiger team, SWAT analysis. Afterwards she translated those terms to me in phrases that a human being can actually understand and I did what every good partner does in a solid marriage. I made fun of that word relentlessly. I may not make as much money as my wife's colleagues. I certainly don't have the degrees they do but I know a messed up thing when I hear it. And I devoted years of my life to compiling, researching and then writing a BS dictionary. Yes, thank you. Thank you. I can now tell my kids that an auditorium full of people applauded me for all this worthless work I did over the last few years. So in the words of BS, with this expertise I say to you that my presentation to you today, the CTA of this DIY TEDx talk if you will, is a USP on the rise of BS in our WIFM world and how we can make this Intel less scalable during the fourth industrial revolution. If you don't understand what I've just said, that's okay, you don't speak BS. If you do understand what I've just said, God help you. Yes. So let me give it another shot. I'll translate that in more common words. The call to action of my presentation to you is to make the point that business speak is on the rise in our globalized economy. But there are simple things we can all do in our day to day jobs with that language to take the bullshit out of BS. So what I present to you is three ways of how to take the BS out of business speak. First, you've been sitting for a while so let me pull the room. I'm going to get your feet working here. I want you to stomp your feet, honestly, stomp your feet if you know what the BS term EBITDA means. Nice. Okay. Maybe we've got some CEOs, some accountants in the room, you never know. Okay now stomp your feet if you know what earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization means. A little bit more. To be honest, I'm sure some of you with amortization were like, I don't know if I should stomp. Right? Okay, now stomp your feet if you know what income is before applying accounting and tax write offs to it. It's a close call but I'm going to make a judgment call here. The loudest stomping in this theater got to the last definition of the same thing. EBITDA is basically income before you apply accounting and tax write offs to it. And notice that the most common language got the biggest agreement from this audience. But here's the problem with BS. It is not a common language. Business speak is the language of the elite. Not surprisingly, when my co-author and I, Tim Ito, researched about 300 business speak terms for this dictionary, one of the reoccurring themes is the people who created this language and speak it most fluently. A large majority of them are people who look like me. A bunch of white guys. I'd say that's not surprisingly because I want you to think of the first and second industrial revolution when white guys like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie ruled the business world. And it's true today when research shows that 90% of all worldwide Fortune 500 company CEOs are white guys still. So here's a takeaway for you in the room. If you want to hang with today's white male tycoons, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett, it would benefit you to get very adept and able to speak BS. But there's a drawback to that approach. I have a friend, Emily, who works at a theater company in the United States. This theater company does corporate entertainment keynote speeches for conferences. She started her job a few years ago and had her first big meeting to try to make a sale. It was with a big oil company in Dallas and across the boardroom from her were five old white guys. And Emily noticed very early on that they did something very interesting with their language choices. They started to use BS words that they knew she didn't know. Now why would they do that? Three possible reasons. I talked to Emily. We've worked out some theories. One, these guys didn't know any better. An economist, Robin Hogarth, had coined the term the curse of knowledge to describe this phenomenon. It may be simply that they're so expert at their language, they don't appreciate anymore what it's like to not know these things. And they just spoke off the top of their head. As a corporate consultant for public speaking, the companies that I work for, the reason I give them this advice is because of that phenomenon. I will tell them if you have a lot of BS in your four walls and it could be unique just to your company or it's just general acronyms and things you use in the business world, and you have a new employee, maybe give them a directory of some of these terms. So instead of walking into a meeting and smiling and nodding and then frantically Googling afterwards what the hell does EBITDA mean, that they'll know. Second reason why these five oil executives possibly handled Emily this way. They wanted to parse out from her how much they knew, how much she knew about the business. Instead of asking her directly, excuse me Emily, can you tell me how much experience you have in our industry and let's go from there. They used BS as a way to keep Emily and them apart rather than bring them together. Third possible reason these oil executives handled it that way, they were just jerks. And Emily thinks that's the answer. Because shortly after her initial conversation she brought in a more senior male colleague, lo and behold the five oil executives warm up, they cut out the BS and a deal is struck shortly thereafter. So that's something for us to think about. As our first take away of how to take the BS out of business speak. Use BS to be inclusive and not exclusive. In other words, don't be a jerk. If you can explain something in common language, that's a victory. The edit is the genius. Not spouting off all these big words. Which brings me to my second take away of how to take BS out of business speak. Let's get those feet stomping again. How many of you stomp your feet if you know what the word de minimis means? Okay, good. I don't feel so alone. Because I was like a lot of you did not stomp your feet a few years back. As was mentioned in my intro, I used to work for the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. For those of you who don't know, it is a comedy show that's nationally broadcast in America that satirized the news of the day. I was interviewing an accountant about a tax issue that he used the word de minimis to describe. I interrupted him right there and I said, de minimis, what? What the F does that mean? He said it means small, immaterial, it's insignificant. To which I said, well, why didn't you just say that? He said in a moment of honesty, he said, I just thought it sounded good. And the reality is it does sound, it's kind of a cool word, de minimis. And I'm guilty of doing it too, especially in a business meeting where I'm unsure of my status in that room. I may use eboda, right? Just to show, hey, I can hang. I can hang. But here's the thing about communication. You know what's really cool about good communication, especially in the business world, is when you can express fresh ideas without using stale business cliches and big words that people in the room don't really understand. So that's my second way to take the BS out of business language, for you. To drive this home even further, a lady that I worked with in my corporate work works for a big American company, one of the biggest companies in America, if not the world. She works for bosses that use a ton of business cliches, so much so to keep herself sane, she told me she created homemade BS bingo cards. Replace the numbers in the bingo cards with the phrases that they used over and over again. So when they turned up the BS in a conference call, she tuned out and tried to play bingo. B, think outside the box. I, change agent. And paradigm shift, right? So these are things for us to think about. That if we're using BS, a lot of it, in our business speak, it may be like Shakespeare said, sound and fury signifying nothing. Which brings me to my final takeaway of how to take BS out of business speak. Let's stick with Shakespeare. Shakespeare has given us some great BS speak and stuff that allows itself to exist outside of business speak in the English language. Wild goose chase, think about that, it's kind of a weird reference. That's from Shakespeare. Break the ice in a pickle, all from Shakespeare. The good news is when we hear references like this from Shakespeare, a lot of us in the world at least have a little bit of an experience with Shakespeare. And we have context clues we can figure it out. But I want you to think of other cultural touch points that aren't as common as Shakespeare. I'm going to put up some phrases that are commonly used in America. And if you know it's common origin, just yell it out. Swing for the fences, out of left field, rain check, off base, pinch hitter, right off the bat. Anybody know? Baseball, there you go. I'm going to put up another list of phrases. Again, you tell me what the common origin is. Wind leading the blind, by the skin of your teeth, fly in the ointment, writing is on the wall. The Bible. No rest for the wicked also comes from the Bible. Here's my point. Think of the global economy now. And the majority of people on this earth don't have daily experience with American baseball and they don't read the Bible. But you're sitting in a business meeting saying we have no time, no rest for the wicked. The writing is on the wall. Do they know what you're talking about? Clap your hands if you've ever heard the American phrase, drinking the Kool-Aid. Great. Anybody who clapped their hands, what does it mean? It's accepting something without question. Just like I did with you guys saying stomp your feet. Here's the origin story of drinking the Kool-Aid. The reason I bring this up is because it's important to know the origin story of some of our BS. Jim Jones, this cult leader, 1978, he has a great idea. All of his hundreds of followers, he's going to give them a delicious drink. That's wonderful Jim Jones to do. He flavors it with something called flavor aid, which is popular at the time. It's later confused in history with a more popular flavor drink in America called Kool-Aid. But Jim made a bad mistake with that Kool-Aid, man. He laced it with cyanide. Hundreds of followers drink the cyanide and die. 1978. That's the origin story of drinking the Kool-Aid. The reason I bring that up is because a European audience, you're like what is Kool-Aid? Also, if you're born beyond 1978, you may not even know what this is. Who is this guy? What are you talking about? Mass suicide, a cult with Kool-Aid? Drinking the Kool-Aid. And there are other BS phrases that fall in this category. We've lost the origin story, it gets muddied. Think of Ted Talk, the internet. If you type who founded Ted or where did Ted come from, it's a person on the internet. It's technology, entertainment, and design. That's what Ted Talk stands for. Think of the BS phrase piggyback. You ever seen two pigs with one pig on its back? I haven't either. Here's why. Because the origin story of this phrase is actually pick back or pick pack. But it was so commonly misstated as piggyback that that mispronunciation was adopted. And now it means piggyback. The pigs are like, what the hell are you talking about? Here's the takeaway out of all of this, is that BS terms can get lost in translation. And I want you to think of some of your own cultural BS that we use around the world. For example, in America, if a company is without money, you might say it's broke. In Italy, you would say it's in the green. In Spain, you would say it's without white. Right? In America, if you're doing a very easy task, you might say it was a piece of cake. In New Zealand, you say, Bob's your uncle. Right? If you have a very hard task that will never happen, in America, you would probably say, oh, it'll happen when pigs fly. In the Netherlands, a Dutch worker would say when the calves dance on the ice. And in Russia, they would say when a crayfish whistles from the mountaintop. Means the same thing. In Japan, if you are doing a work task and you need help, you're desperate for anybody, you may say, I'll adopt cat paws. In America, if you were given a task that is one day over a long-term project and, man, you're just getting started, you may say that it's a drop in the bucket. In China, they have the same idea communicated through the phrase of nine cows and only one cow thread. So those are examples of cultural differences with BS. And I'd be remiss to leave you without calling out some of the regional fondness for food in your BS, in the German language. Think of yourself, when you're in a business meeting in Germany or in Austria with the German language, if you want to add your two cents in America, you'd say your two cents. Here you say, I want to add my mustard. Okay? And once you get that mustard, you want to be as clear as dumpling broth about what you're trying to say, right? You certainly don't want to come across as somebody who has tomatoes on their eyes, you know? And the last thing you want to do in that scenario is you don't want to talk around the hot porridge, okay? Which is the equivalent of beating around the bush with American BS. I've given you a lot of bullshit over a short amount of time, so I'm going to wrap it up with a little BS language and we'll recap here. Using BS, what I am trying to say is disambiguate the net net of this dog and pony show for you thought leaders. And I'm going to call out the elephant in the room with the three takeaways here. First takeaway, use BS to be inclusive, not exclusive. Second takeaway is to make sure that you express fresh ideas without stale business cliches or big words that maybe your audience doesn't really understand. And then finally, appreciate that a lot of our BS is lost in translation depending on the audience. If we can all do this, think of how little less bullshit there would be in the world and what a wonderful thing that would be. Thank you very much."}, "podcast_summary": "In his TEDx talk, journalist and consultant Bob Wilkfong discusses the prevalence of business speak, also known as BS, in the workplace. He explains that business speak is a language used to describe and define things in a professional setting, but it can often be confusing and exclusionary. Wilkfong points out that the majority of people creating and speaking this language are white males, reflecting the historical dominance of white men in the business world. He suggests three ways to remove the BS from business speak: using BS to be inclusive, expressing ideas without cliches and jargon, and recognizing the potential for BS to get lost in translation. By doing so, workplaces can foster better communication and create a more inclusive environment.", "podcast_guest": "Bob Wilkfong", "podcast_guest_details": {"Guest Name": "Bob Wilkfong", "Guest Job": "journalist and consultant", "Guest Fame": "BS dictionary", "Guest City": "globalized economy", "Guest Website": null, "Guest Media": null}, "podcast_highlights": {"highlight_1": "Business speak is the language of the elite", "highlight_2": "Use BS to be inclusive, not exclusive", "highlight_3": "Express fresh ideas without using stale business cliches", "highlight_4": "Appreciate that BS can be lost in translation depending on the audience"}, "podcast_score": {"score": "4", "review": "This podcast was an interesting exploration of the use of business jargon and its impact on communication.
